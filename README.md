# Drag to Goal

A minimalist puzzle game where you drag a ball to the goal while avoiding obstacles and enemies.

## How to Play

2. **Move your mouse** to steer the ball (it follows at constant speed)
3. **Reach the green goal** to complete the level
4. **Avoid** red obstacles and enemies!

## Mechanics

- **Drag Timer**: You can only drag for 3 seconds at a time
- **Cooldown**: After dragging, wait 1 second before you can drag again
- **Enemies**: They activate when you click the ball and chase you (getting faster over time)
- **Zones** (Level 3): Blue zones slow you down, orange zones speed you up

## Levels

1. **Level 1**: Avoid moving obstacles
2. **Level 2**: Obstacles + 1 enemy
